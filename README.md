# GenerateAllPartitionArray

The GenerateAllPartitionArray backtracking algorithm generates a musical structure created by Milton Babbitt (1916â€“2011) known as an all-partition array. 
An all-parititon array is an N-by-M regular matrix, A, containing (N * M) / 12 integers each of [0, 11] that can be "covered" by the K distinct 
partitions of 12 into N parts or fewer. Each of these K partitions contains 12 distinct matrix elements [0, 11] whose N 
or fewer parts each consist of consecutive row locations in A. Parts from each of these K partitions are "packed" or ordered 
sequentially in A from left to right. The number of elements in these partitions, K * 12, required to cover A exceeds the 
number of elements in A. For this reason, an all-partition array will have (K * 12) - (N * M) overlapping locations in A 
between contiguous partitions. Such partitions may overlap in at most one row location in A for each of their contiguous 
parts. This row location in A must be the right-most element of some part in a partition k and the left-most element of 
a part in the same row in A of some contiguous partition greater than k (i.e., to its right).

## Installation

Clone or download the generate-all-partition-arrays repository to your machine and place it in a directory accessible by [Julia](https://julialang.org).

Be sure you have Julia version 1.1.0 or above as well as the Combinatorics, DelimitedFiles, and Statistics packages.


## Usage

The GenerateAllPartitionArray algorithm can be run from the command line in the Julia REPL with the following two commands:

```julia

cd("/user/name/path/to/generate-all-partition-arrays/src")

include("GenerateAllPartitionArray.jl")

```

The default matrix is one constructed by Babbitt having the following characteristics: 6 x 96 requiring 58 partitions and 120 overlaps. After initial preprocessing, you will be prompted to select whether or not you would like the algorithm to run with search heuristics. It is recommended that you do so. You are also given the option of selecting which heuristics to use.
